# Basic shell environment for starting on fishtank :slightly_smiling_face:
**A basic bashrc with some useful aliases.** \
Checkout https://phoenixnap.com/kb/bash-commands for some basic bash commands. \
Set up is easy - within your home directory, 
```console
cd ~
```
clone into this repository with
```console
git clone https://github.com/brownsfrib/basic-bash-env.git
```
\
From there, move the files from the repository into your home directory with
```console
mv -i -t /~ ./.bashrc ./.bash_aliases ./.bash_profile ./.bash_functions ./.fishtankhelp-msg
```
\
Here's a quick list of the custom functions to help you get started: \
1. **githelp** \-\- Helpful commands for setting up a git repository, adding files, commiting, pushing, etc. 
2. **cmdhelp** \-\- A list of some common (and useful) bash commands (ls, cat, mv, etc). 
3. **practiceDir** \-\- Takes you to /mnt/simulations/hira/Sam/CodePractice/ where you can find some python and ROOT examples 
	* Better examples can be found online, but take a look if you want. As of 9/3/24 I need to update this directory.
